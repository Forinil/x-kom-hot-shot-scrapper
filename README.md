# x-kom.pl Hot Deal Scrapper

Simple script that reads the current hot shot deal from x-kom.pl and posts it to Slack.

The script also writes the data to STDOUT and saves it in a CSV-formatted log file for debugging purposes.

It should be run by cron or similar software twice a day - after the deal changes.
